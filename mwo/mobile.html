           <h2>Briefcase</h2>
           <p>Briefcase is a mobile based job search platform for students and career service centers. I work as Director of User Experience for the company and was therefore in charge of design and development. We designed and developed two versions, with this being the final version. While a web app, we are planning on making it a native app soon.</p>

           <h2>PaleoFit</h2>
           <p>Designed during an entreprenurial competition, MECA, in Kansas City. The team was tasked with improving the business model thorugh innovative thinking, technology, and design. I was on hand to help all 6 teams create an app design for them that day. It was a crazy rush and really tested my ability for fast prototyping. PaleoFit is a life tracker for individuals participating in the Paleo lifestyle. They can compete and encourage each other to do better in their daily lives.</p>

           <h2>FolioMatch</h2>
           <p>I worked as a Creative Director for this company, who created a platform for students to document their pre-post-secondary education, as a sort of visual resume, which would then be used to help them get matched to scholarships and schools. While there I was in charge of the entire visual design direction for the company. It was my first foray into product and interface design and I learned so much.</p>

           <h2>Wichita YMCA</h2>
           <p>While working as a contractor for a development company recently, I worked on porting over their website over to a mobile app that could be naviagated with ease while still adhering to both Apple's standard as well as the Y's design standards. The goal was for people to manage their class schedules, as well as search for new classes, get nutritional tips and motivation from the YMCA. All of this had to be done that afternoon, so it was fun to quick throw something together using my useablitly knowledge.</p>
